### DM852 Introduction to Generic Programming Spring 2022

This project contains the assignments, and the final exam for the course Introduction to Generic Programming, all of which were individual.

- Assignment 1 contains a basic implementation of a doubly linked list for strings and a binary tree mapping integers to strings.

- Assignment 2 changes the implementation from assignment 1 to be generic.

- The exam consisted of implementing a basic generic graph library based on the Boost Graph Library (BGL), but using some of the newest features of C++20 such as Concepts. The implementation was only allowed to use the STL and the Boost Iterator Library. The implementation was also an exercise in using compile-time- and metaprogramming.
